It is the prerogative of the professor to change the course during the term. Such changes will be posted in an updated syllabus and a notice will be communicated to the students.

### Added March 24, 2021 LeBow Syllabus Statements (Spring 2020-21)

#### Time Zones and Assignment Due Dates

Drexel’s Blackboard servers are in the Eastern Time Zone. All due dates and times are displayed in Eastern Time. Students are responsible for adjusting any deadlines to their own time zone. If a student is significantly shifted from the Eastern Time Zone and an exam is scheduled to take place during their night hours, that student should contact the instructor at least 3-4 days ahead of the exam to ask about alternative arrangements.

#### Email Correspondence 

Students should check their Drexel email at least three (3) times per week for any important course-related information. Students should only send instructor questions from their Drexel email account and not from an external account like Gmail, etc. For security purposes, Drexel professors are instructed not to reply to student emails sent from non-Drexel email addresses, and instructors will only use their own official Drexel email accounts to communicate with students.

#### Appropriate Use of Course Materials

It is important to recognize that some or all the course materials provided to you may be the intellectual property of Drexel University, the course instructor, or others. Use of this intellectual property is governed by Drexel University policies, including the IT-1 policy found at: https://drexel.edu/it/about/policies/policies/01-Acceptable-Use/

Briefly, this policy states that all course materials including recordings provided by the course instructor may not be copied, reproduced, distributed, or re-posted. Doing so may be considered a breach of this policy and will be investigated and addressed as possible academic dishonesty, among other potential violations. Improper use of such materials may also constitute a violation of the University’s Code of Conduct found at: https://drexel.edu/cpo/policies/cpo-1/ and will be investigated as such.

#### Getting Technical Support

Students who need technical support can use the following contacts. When emailing about urgent matters, include your phone number for tech representatives to call back if needed.

- Drexel Accounts
  I cannot log in, multi-factor authentication, Office365, etc.
  Contact: consult@drexel.edu
  
- Zoom Support
  Logging in, using Zoom, accessing class session, technical issues, etc.

  Options: 1) Help option within the Zoom app (for general Zoom support)
2) LeBow Tech: lcbtech@drexel.edu (answered during business hours)
3) Drexel 24/7 support: 215-895-1224 (high urgency or after business hours)

- Blackboard Support
  Course materials, videos, assignments, tests, etc.

  Contact: 1) Drexel 24/7 support: 215-895-1224
2) LeBow Instructional Tech: lebowintech@drexel.edu
  
- Business Software/vApps (SAS, JMP, MATLAB, Minitab, Stata, etc.)
  Contact: LeBow Tech: lcbtech@drexel.edu
  
#### Assignment Feedback and Grades

Using the instructor's preferred method of communication for student questions (email, phone, etc. as indicated in the syllabus) may shorten instructor response times. In general, faculty check their email at least once per weekday and once on the weekend, but given the current emergency, these frequencies may vary. Grades and feedback for assignments and tests will normally be posted to Blackboard Learn within two weeks of the due date.

#### Remote Class Video Participation 

In-person students earn class participation credit by arriving on time and joining in discussions and activities. The equivalent in a remote class is to join Zoom on time and be attentive and engaged. Having your camera turned on contributes to this class community and engagement. Students are encouraged to turn their cameras on as much as possible. Students who are concerned about showing their living space are welcome to use the blur background feature in Zoom or another, non-offensive virtual background. Students without a working laptop camera should purchase an external webcam. In cases of hardship, students can contact LeBow Instructional Tech (lebowintech@drexel.edu) to ask about the availability of loaner cameras.

#### Class Session Recordings

During the activation of Drexel’s emergency response plan, courses which were to take place in a classroom will now be facilitated remotely using Zoom and through supplemental uses of Blackboard. Any synchronous class sessions will take place during the originally scheduled class time. Sessions will be recorded and can be made available to students who, due to substantial time zone shift or illness, are not able to attend the live event. Students should contact their instructor as soon as possible if they anticipate this need. Faculty office hours will also take place via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc. Meeting links will be placed in Blackboard for easy student access.

#### Academic Honesty for Remote Courses 

Students should understand that remote or online learning does not affect Drexel’s policies for academic honesty. Course work must be completed using only the materials, resources, and collaboration options that are permitted. Collaborating on individual student assignments and tests is strictly prohibited (vs. group projects where collaboration is expected). Academic integrity incidents will follow the normal processes and will be taken just as seriously in remote courses as they would in person. Students who know of academic dishonesty incidents should inform faculty or college administration in a timely manner, or else they may be subject to similar disciplinary actions.
