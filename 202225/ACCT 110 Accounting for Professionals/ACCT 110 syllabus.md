## ACADEMIC HONESTY
Taking classes remotely does not provide the same level of supervision by faculty for assessments and individual work that is present in the classroom.  Students must understand that this does not affect Drexel’s policies for academic honesty. Course work should be completed using only the materials, resources, and collaboration options permitted by the instructor.  Collaborating on individual assignments and tests is strictly prohibited.  Academic integrity incidents will still follow the normal processes and will be taken just as seriously in this remote course facilitation model as they would in person.  Students who know of academic dishonesty incidents should inform faculty or college administration in a timely manner or else they may be subject to similar disciplinary actions

Cheating and plagiarism are serious misconduct issues that result in negative consequences for all involved in the learning environment.  Any serious misconduct of this nature will be addressed directly and expeditiously by LeBow College of Business and Drexel University.  In order to protect and maintain a superior learning environment at LeBow College of Business, all students must review and adhere to Drexel University’s Academic Honesty Policy  http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic-integrity/ .  For details, see: http://drexel.edu/studentlife/community_standards/studentHandbook/  (see Code of Conduct under Judicial Affairs).

Forms of academic dishonesty include plagiarism, fabrication, cheating, and academic misconduct.  Students are responsible for the authenticity of material submitted both for individual and group work.  The Hagerty Library offers a brief online tutorial for recognizing and avoiding plagiarism at: http://www.library.drexel.edu/resources/tutorials/plagiarism/plagiarism.html.
If there is evidence that a violation of Drexel University’s Academic Honesty Policy has occurred, the faculty member indicates what sanction he/she believes is appropriate to the Department Head, who in turn will determine whether such a sanction is commensurate with the action and evidence, and if necessary makes adjustments to the sanction.  For the first infraction, the sanction may include:
•	An "F" for the assignment or exam 
•	Reduction of course grade 
•	Failure for the entire course, with the inability to withdraw, or 
•	Other action deemed appropriate by the faculty member. Examples include, but are not limited to, requiring the student to re-take the exam, re-complete an assignment, or complete an assigned exercise.
