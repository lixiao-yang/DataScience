## 3 Student Learning Information

**Course Description** Introduces the foundation and the state of the art of information visualization. Explores and reflects on the design, application, and evaluation of a variety of common data and graph types.

**Pre- and Co- requisites** None  

**Course Rationale** This course provides the foundation of information visualization from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The course aims to develop students’ ability to find the most effective solutions to a range of problems known as wicked problems. Wicked problems are hard to conceptualize as a problem with a single solution. Rather, one has to iteratively improve their understanding through explorations and reconsiderations of the relevant data from multiple perspectives. This course offers a set of practical skills essential to deal with core challenges of informatics. This course prepares students for the more advanced courses such as visual analytics, which deals with more challenging and demanding informatics issues of a broader scope and uncertainty. While this course emphasizes how a number of common types of information can be visually, intuitively and interactively represented, the visual analytics course focuses on analytic reasoning and how to make sense of what is going on with limited and uncertain information.

**Course Outcomes** Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:
- Explain fundamental principles of information visualization
- Explain key stages of an information visualization process 
- Characterize visual representations of common data types
- Perform standard tasks in information visualization systems
- Evaluate the design options for a given elementary task

The course will provide students first-hand experiences by exploring a series of information visualization software to consolidate the conceptual and theoretical theme of the course. The development of critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in the context of information visualization will be reinforced throughout the course in both conceptual and practical themes, including investigating open-ended research issues and planning and devising viable solutions to real-world problems.

**Presentation** The course content will be presented with a combination of lectures, lab sessions, class discussions.

**Course Content**  
- Introduction
- Types of visualization
- Types of user behaviors
- Types of data
- Grammar of graphics
- Cognitive science of visualization
- Visualization as storytelling

**Assessment**  
- The tools and methods for the assessment include individual projects, mid-term, and participations in the discussions.
- The understanding of the foundation of the field will be assessed in terms of the perspectives, focuses, and approaches demonstrated in the course projects and discussions. 
- The expected learning of theoretical and practical challenges will be assessed based on discussions and the extent to which students demonstrate the connections between a concrete example and relevant theories and scholarly studies.
- The understanding of strengths and weaknesses of key techniques will be assessed in terms of whether they are identified with specific details and an adequate coverage.

## 4 Drexel Student Learning Priorities

The learning objectives of the course are in line with the following priorities in particular:

**Core Intellectual and Practical Skills**

**CREATIVE AND CRITICAL THINKING**  
Use divergent and convergent thinking to generate novel and relevant ideas, strategies, approaches, or products

**TECHNOLOGY USE**  
Make appropriate use of technologies to communicate, collaborate, solve problems, make decisions, and conduct research, as well as foster creativity and life-long learning

**Experiential and Applied Learning** 

**GLOBAL COMPETENCE**  
Engage in, reflect upon, and demonstrate open mindedness towards all issues of diversity at the local, national, and international level
