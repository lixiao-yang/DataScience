## Commitment to Linguistic Diversity and Inclusive and Equitable Pedagogies

Students in our class may represent a variety of linguistic backgrounds. If you use English as an additional language, you are invited to write in your first language whenever it is helpful (such as in first drafts and notes), to use vocabulary that do not have translations in English, to use sources that are written in your first language, and to conduct primary research in your first language. I am committed to facilitating your learning, and along that journey, I will respect your voice and identity and value your linguistic differences. If you use English as a first language, please know that in this classroom, multilingual writers are to be treated with respect. Their feedback during peer review is to be valued, their voices during class discussions are to be invited and heard, and “written accent” is to be respected. We want everyone’s point to be heard, understood, and shared with others in a way that is authentic.   

In addition, it is my hope that your learning in this course will contribute to making our campus community a more welcoming and supportive space where you and all people of all genders and sexualities feel they belong.

Sincerely,

Dr. Lisa

## Course Description

Advances students’ development in the writing processes and the use of writing as a tool for inquiry. Promotes the critical evaluation and integration of information into students’ own writing as they research complex and open-ended issues. Continues review of grammar, style, and documentation conventions, such as MLA or APA format. Encourages collaboration and effective strategies for searching the Internet and library resources. Engages students in reflection and promotes positive attitude towards writing.

## Course Purpose 

In the First-Year Writing Program, we focus on two of the Drexel Student Learning Priorities: communication and self-directed learning. We encourage students to write clearly with a firm sense of their readers—the people with whom they are communicating. We believe that when writers connect with their readers about subjects of real concern to the writers, they will more readily continue to learn and practice writing on their own, an attitude we believe is fundamental to improving one’s writing. As a result, our students will use writing effectively in their personal, academic, and professional lives.

What will I do and learn in this course? In English 102, students will develop the following skills and competencies, and be able to apply them to personal, academic, and professional situations, including co-op:

- You will research to enhance your understanding of topics that are meaningful to you.

- You will integrate information from outside sources into your written work in an ethical manner using correct documentation styles

- You will accurately use MLA or APA documentation styles. 

- You will find reputable information using Internet and library searches.

- You will reflect on your own writing and research processes to consider how context, experience, and identity inform this work.

- You will respond productively to classmates’ writing.

- You will write persuasive arguments appropriate to audiences both inside and outside of academia.

- You will improve clarity, grammar, and mechanics.

- You will develop a more positive attitude towards writing.

Our class will make extensive use of BbLearn. We will do a great deal of writing during the class period, so it will be necessary for you to bring a laptop to class.

### Informal Writing

Informal writing assignments are an important component of your grade in this course. Each week, you will be required to write several hundred words in response to readings, professor questions, and ongoing discussion of your projects. In addition, we will use informal writing for regular discussion of grammar and mechanics. These informal writings may include discussion threads on Blackboard Learn, blogs, notebooks, journals, peer reviews, and in-class writings.

### Major Projects

You will have three major composition projects in this course. Specific assignments and due dates are listed in the “Descriptions of Major Projects” section below.

## Course Policies and Resources

### Class Participation and Attendance

It is important that you attend every class session. Otherwise, you will miss out on the many learning activities that we will engage in. Class participation means being present and prepared— and actively engaging in our class discussions, the readings, and writing.

Missing more than 10% of class meetings due to unexcused absences will result in reduced grades. Missing more than 20% of class time can result in failing the course. An excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student’s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or essential travel; an official university event (e.g., academics, athletics or performing arts); or a religious holiday. Please reach out to me if you need an excused absence; I understand that sickness and emergencies happen!

Being on time is also important. If you’re often late to class, I may mark you absent. If you’re coming from a building across campus, just let me know you might be a few minutes late to our class.

### Add/Drop/Withdraw

You will have until the end of the 1st week to add or drop a course. Please note that you are responsible for any work you miss in the late addition of a course. For more information on Add/Drop, please visit http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-add-drop. Undergraduates have until the end of the 7th week of the term to withdraw.

### Inclusive Learning and Disability Accommodations

Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and bring different strengths and needs to the class. If there are aspects of the course that prevent you from learning or make you feel excluded, please let me know as soon as possible. Together, we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. 

If you have a disability and require accommodations, please let me know as soon as possible. You will need to register with the Office of Disability Resources. Then you will need to present a current accommodation verification letter (AVL) to me so I can implement the accommodations. AVLs are issued by the Office of Disability Resources (ODR).

## Descriptions of Major Projects

### Assignment 1: Personal Reflection about the course theme (due weeks 3 and 4)

Our course theme of identity, race, and culture touches many peoples’ lives in a variety of ways. In this essay, consider the ways in which identity and/or race and/or culture had an impact upon your personal life, your academic life, or your professional life. By way of preparation, review Abrams, "Reflecting on an Experience." EmpoWORD: A Student-Centered Anthology and Handbook for College Writers. Find a link to this in the First-Year Writing Resource SharePoint site, available in Blackboard.

Think of this essay not as an end, but as preliminary thinking about your research throughout this term. Your personal reflection should be no longer than 1000 words.

### Assignment 2:  Annotated Bibliography (due weeks 6 and 7)

This assignment is an intermediate step towards writing the final project. Consider your thinking about identity in your personal reflection. What kinds of sources can you find that you might be able to refine your thinking? Using the instructions in Chapter 14 of Writing Guide with Handbook, you will write an annotated bibliography that uses no fewer than four reputable sources, one or two of which can be from the “Course Readings” and the rest of which you will find yourselves. Furthermore, your annotated bibliography should have a relevant title, and an introduction that states the scope of your research. To find articles, and to determine whether they are reputable, review Chapter 12 of Writing Guide with Handbook. 

Your annotated bibliography should follow MLA or APA documentation format and be no longer than 1200 words.

As you draft and revise, utilize peer feedback, my office hours, and The Drexel Writing Center.

### Assignment 3: Arguing a Position (due weeks 9 and 10)

For this assignment, argue a position having to do with some aspect of the course theme: identity, race, and culture. Your discussion should integrate your own ideas, the ideas of your classmates, and the ideas in the sources you have been reading. For the basic definitions and structures of arguments, consult Chapters 10, 11, and 12. Your final project, in MLA or APA format, should be no longer than 1500 words.
