## Methods of Evaluation

### Process for evaluating achievement of learning objectives:

1. Examinations: There will be four exams, three during the quarter and the other during the final exam week. Each exam will include objective (multiple-choice, true/false, fill in the blanks and matching) questions

2. Assignments: There will be three assignments and few in-class activities. Test content will be based on both the readings and the lectures. You can take any two assignments out of the three. If you take all three, two assignments with highest scores will be considered for final grading.

3. Attendance: You are allowed to take up to two excused absences with prior intimation to the professor. However, if you miss any exams, assignments, and in-class activities, they will not be conducted again for you and zero points will be assigned to the corresponding missed work.

4. There are no extra credit assignments for this course. All grades are final

### Instructor Feedback:

Assignment grades and feedback are provided by the faculty member via Blackboard in My Grades. Feedback on assignments is provided within 7-10 days depending on the length of the assignment or activity

You are expected to submit all assignments and exams when due. Assignments submitted after the due date will result in zero points unless prior arrangements have been made with the professor. Unexcused late assignments will not be accepted. If you think that you have an acceptable excuse for missing an upcoming assignment due date, you need to discuss it with me PRIOR to the due date.

Vacations or other pre-planned social events are not accepted for extension requests. In such cases, arrangements will need to be made by the student for submitting on-time assignments.

Technical excuses (such as computer problems or crash) will not be acceptable excuses for missing an assignment. Make-up assignments are not offered for this course; if you have a university-accepted excuse (such as sickness with a medical doctor’s note) to miss a quiz, you may be excused from the exam and your other quizzes and assignments will be worth more.

## Weighting (Grading Matrix):

The final course grade will be determined according to the following formula:

| Exams /Assignments | Weight % |
|-|-|  
| Exam 1 | 20% |   
| Exam 2 | 20% |
