# Question 1
Use a truth table to prove that the following Boolean expressions are logically equivalent. 

$$x\iff y$$
$$(x\implies y) \land (y\implies x)$$ 

# Question 2
Use a truth table to prove that the following Boolean expressions are logically equivalent.
$$(x \lor y) \implies z$$
$$(x\implies z) \land (y \implies z)$$


# Question 3
A *tautology* is a Boolean expression that evaluates to true for all possible values of its variables. For example, $x \lor \neg x$ is True whether $x$ is True or False:

| $x$ | $\neg x$ | $x \lor \neg x$ |
|---|----|-------|
| $T$ | $F$ | $T$     |
| $F$ | $T$ | $T$     |


Prove that the following is a tautology:

$$(x \land (x \implies y)) \implies y$$

# Question 4
Prove that if $x$ is an odd integer and $y$ is an even integer, then $x + y$ is and odd integer. 


# Question 5
Prove that the product of two odd integers is odd. 


# Question 6
Suppose that $a$, $b$, and $c$. Prove that if $a|b$ then $a|bc$. 


# Question 7
Suppose that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers. Prove that if $a|b$ and $c|d$, then $ac|bd$. 


# Question 8 
Prove that the difference between distinct, nonconsecutive perfect squares is composite. 

*Hints:*

- We can represent nonconsecutive squares as $m^2$ and $n^2$ where $n = m + k$, for some $k \geq 2$. 
- Composite means *not prime*. To show that a number is composite, we have to show that it is a multiple of a number other than $1$ and itself. 


# Question 9
Prove by contradiction: If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $ab = 0$, then $a=0$ or $b=0$. 


# Question 10
Prove each statement by contradiction.

## Part a
Prove $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

## Part b
Prove $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational.
