# Homework 4

## Question 1
For each of the following sequences, find a closed formula for $a_n$, the $n^{\text{th}}$ term of the sequence. Assume the first term is $a_0$. Briefly show how you got your answer.

### Part a

$$4, 5, 7, 11, 19, 35, \dots$$

### Part b

$$0,3,8,15,24,35,\dots$$

### Part c

$$6, 12, 20, 30, 42,\dots$$

### Part d

$$0,2,7,15,26,40,57,\dots$$

Hint: These are sometimes called *house numbers*. 

## Question 2

Write out the first five terms, starting with $a_0$, for the sequence below. Then, provide a closed formula. 

$$a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2},\;\text{with } a_0 = 0,\; a_1 = 1$$

## Question 3

Write out the first five terms, starting with $a_0$, for the sequence below. Then, provide a recursive formula. 

$$a_n = n^2 + n$$

Hint: Consider 2.1.3a from the book.

## Question 4

Show that $a_n = 2^n - 5^n$ is a solution to the recurrence relation $a_n = 7a_{n-1} - 10a_{n-2}$. What would the initial conditions need to be for this to be the closed formula for the sequence?

Hint: Consider 3.1.9

## Question 5

Compute the sum $2 + 5 + 8 + \cdots + 59$.

## Question 6

Compute the sum $-3 + 1 + \cdots + 77$.

## Question 7

Find a closed form for the sum of the sequence $a_n = 1 + 4n$ for $n\geq0$.


## Question 8

Compute the sum of the sequence $3\cdot 2^n$ for $n\geq0$.


## Question 9

Express the repeating decimal $0.37373737373737\dots$ as a fraction (without decimals, of course).


## Question 10

Express the repeating decimal $0.213213213213\dots$ as a fraction (without decimals, of course).
