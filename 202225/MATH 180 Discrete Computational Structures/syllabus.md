Office: Korman 224. My mailbox is located in Korman 256

## Prerequisites

Students entering Math 180 are expected to have completed and passed MATH 102 or MATH 121 (D as a minimum grade). If you earned a D in MATH 102 or MATH 121, you should consider retaking it. Any questions regarding your readiness for the course should be resolved immediately.

## Textbook

## Course Description, Expectations, and Objectives

This course is designed to introduce you to the study of discrete mathematical structures in analytic problem-solving. Topics include proof techniques, set theory, combinatorics, relations, functions, and graph theory. Specific course goals are to:

- improve your ability to read and understand mathematical definitions and proofs,
- help you produce clear and mathematically rigorous arguments and demonstrate critical-thinking skills, 
- help you understand basic mathematical structures that are useful for further study of mathematics and related sciences.

The course will be a mixture of short lectures, questions and discussion, and classroom activities that you will investigate in groups or individually.

## Grading

Your grade for this course will be based on the following categories: take-home assignments, one midterm exam and one final exam.

**Graded Homework Assignments:** Each week, we’ll have a graded homework assignment based on that week’s material. These homework assignments are to be submitted in PDF format - no other file format will be accepted. 

If you’d like to type your solutions, I have a short video on how to use typesetting tools on Blackboard. They are fairly intuitive and very useful. Markdown is especially good for creating quick and easy HTML and PDF files. I’ll award a point of extra credit (out of 10) for any typed solutions.

**Exams:** There will be one midterm exam and a final exam at the end of the term. Midterm exam make-ups shall only be given in cases of exceptional circumstances, such as illness or injury with proper documentation provided, or with my prior approval. There will be no make-up given for the final exam.

### Grading Breakdown

Your course grade will be based on the weighted average of the following grades:

- Homework 60%  
- Midterm Exam 20%
- Final Exam 20%

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following system:

| Grade | Percentage |
|-|-|  
| A | 90 - 100 % |
| B | 80 - 89 % |
| C | 70 - 79 % |   
| D | 60 - 69% |
| F | 0 - 59 % |

*Plus and minus will be assigned at the discretion of the instructor.

## Tutoring Services

In addition to your my office hours, you can receive extra assistance in the Math Resource Center (MRC) located in Korman 249. The MRC is staffed by faculty and teaching assistants who can help you with your math courses. No appointment is necessary. Hours and staff schedules can be found at:

## Disabilities and Accommodations

Students requesting accommodations due to a disability at Drexel University need to request a current Accommodations Verification Letter (AVL) in the Clock database before accommodations can be made. These requests are received by Disability Resources (DR), who then issues the AVL to the appropriate contacts. For additional information, visit the DR website.

## Academic Honesty

Cheating and other forms of academic misconduct are serious offenses and are dealt with harshly, e.g. at the very least a 0 on an exam and a letter sent to the Office of Student Conduct. Students should be familiar with the following policies:

It is my prerogative as the instructor to change the course during the term at my discretion. Any changes will be communicated in class, through e-mail and/or via the course website when appropriate. Course announcements, exam information, and other details will be regularly posted to the course website.

You are expected to be fully aware of the following policies and expectations, so review this information carefully and speak with me if you have further questions.
