#| CS 270  Homework 2
Create By Professor Bruce Char, Professor Mark Boady, Professor Jeremy Johnson, and Steve Earth

Complete each of the below functions. Tests given are not resigned to be comprehensive.
They will give you an idea if your code is write, but they do not test all possible cases.
Think about your design. When grading, we may add additional tests for your functions.
Each of the ten questions is worth ten points for a total of 100.

Important Rules:
0. Run your code before submitting it; if it crashes, A ZERO MAY BE GIVEN FOR THE ASSIGNMENT.
1. You may not use any loop constructs; if used, your answer will get a zero.
2. All these functions must be implemented recursively unless otherwise indicated --
 you will receive a zero if there is no recursion (similarly, you will receive a zero if the
directions forbid recursion and you implement the definition recursively).
Note that for some questions, recursive helper functions are allowed
(in which case, the grader will still give credit even with the main function not being recursive).
Although no helper functions need to be created for this assignment.
3. You may not use any Racket commands not discussed in class. If used, your answer will get a zero.
As a general rule, you should only be using functions taught in class (otherwise you are likely missing
the point of the question and endangering your score).
4. Using If/Cond to pass the specific tests provided instead of following the instructions will always
result in a zero for that question.  Do not assume that simply because your code passes all the example
unit tests here then that means you get 100%; we will be testing with input beyond the examples.
The graders will still obey the input contracts.
5. While you are encouraged to create your own comments, NEVER delete any provided comments
(they are used at touchstones by the autograder).
6. This assignment is all about getting familiar with Booleans (i.e. True/False, represented in Racket as #t/#f)
and other abstract representations. Nowhere on this assignment should you be using integers! If you find yourself
using numbers (such as 0s or 1s) or doing any arithmetic operations (such as addition, multiplication, quotient,
remainder etc), then you taking a wrong (and very inefficient) approach to that problem.

#| PART TWO: PNUMS
   ===============

recall from class that Peano numbers, known as "pNums", have two constructors,
one of which, succ, is recursive. And "DubNums" have three constructors, two of
which ("double" and "double-plus1") are recursive.

1)  Peano arithmetic

    In words:  A number is either zero, or, recursively, the successor of a number is a number.
    Formally,  pNum := pzero|(succ pNum)

2)  DubNum arithmetic

    In words:  A DubNum is either zero, or recursively, doubling
    a (nonzero) number or doubling a number and adding one gives a dubNum.

    Formally,  DubNum := dubzero|(double X)|(double-plus1 Y), where Y is any DubNum, and X is any nonzero DubNum

    We can interpret dubnums by assigning zero to the number zero
    and if B is a dubnum representing the integer value b, than
    (double B) has value 2b and (double-plus1 B) has value 2b+1.

    Note that it might seem like there is more than one way to construct dubnums with
    the same value.  E.G.  (double dubzero) would have the same value as zero, so our
    definition of double prevents constructions such as '(double (double dubzero))

    When recursively processing either types of numbers, you must
    handle cases corresponding to the different constructors.  Recursive
    calls must have inputs whose size is smaller, where size is the
    number of constructors needed to build the number.

    In this second part of this assignment you will write recursive functions to arithmetic operations on a
    *representation* of the integers, using Peano numbers (aka "rock arithmetic"). And then in the third part,
    you will write recursive functions to do arithmetic on a different (better)
    representation of the integers, called DubNums (the official recursive definition is given above).

Below are some instructor defined functions. read them over to make sure you understand them:
pzero? is the peano equivalent of the racket function zero?
pnum? is the predicate determining if the input is a legal peano number
succ returns the successor of a peano number.  in other words, if N is the peano number representing n,
then (succ N) is the peano number representing n+1
lastly, when N is the peano number representing n>0, then (pred N) is the peano number representing n-1
(aka the "predecessor")
|#

(define (pzero? N) (equal? N 'pzero))
(define (pnum? N) (if (zero? N) #t (and (equal? (length N) 2) (equal? (first N) 'succ) (pnum? (second N)))))
(define (succ N) (list 'succ N))
(define (pred N) (if (pzero? N) 'pzero (second N)))

;also, here are some handy definitions we can use as shortcuts for typing
(define zero 'pzero)
(define one (succ zero))
(define two (succ one))
(define three (succ two))
(define four (succ three))
(define five (succ four))
(define six (succ five))
(define seven (succ six))
(define eight (succ seven))
(define nine (succ eight))
(define ten (succ nine))

; Please study the next three functions given below carefully and make sure you understand how they work.
; You may utilize these in your solutions if you wish.

; Input: M, N are pnums representing the integers m,n
; Output: (plus M N) is the pnum representing m+n
; Example: (plus two three) would be five, i.e. (succ (succ (succ (succ (succ pzero))))), since 2+3=5
(define (plus M N)
  (if (pzero? M) N (succ (plus (pred M) N))))

; Input: M, N are pnums representing the integers m,n
; Output: (mult M N) is the pnum representing m*n
; Example: (mult two three) would be six, i.e. (succ (succ (succ (succ (succ (succ pzero)))))), since 2*3=6
(define (mult M N)
  (if (pzero? M) zero (plus N (mult (pred M) N))))

; Input: M, N are pnums representing the integers m,n
; Output: (ltpnum? M N) is the predicate representation of m < n. In other words, the output is the boolean #t if m < n and #f otherwise.
; Examples: (ltpnum? two three) would be #t since it is true that 2 < 3.  however (ltpnum? five four) would be #f since it is false that 5 < 4
(define (ltpnum? M N)
  (cond
    [(pzero? N) #f]
    [(pzero? M) #t]
    [else (ltpnum? (pred M) (pred N))]))

; Question 6: subtraction of Peano numbers
; Input: M, N are pnums representing the integers m,n
; Output: (sub M N) is the pnum representing m-n if m >= n and zero otherwise
; Example: (sub five three) would be two, i.e. (succ (succ pzero)), since 5 -3 = 2
(define (sub M N)
  null); replace this null here with the lines of your code

; Question 7: Division of Peano numbers
; Input: ; Input: M, N are pnums representing the integers m,n where n > 0
; Output: the pnum representing the quotient of m divided by n (recall that quotient drops all fractions)
; Example: (div seven three) would be two, i.e. (succ (succ pzero)), since (quotient 7 3) is 2
(define (div M N)
  null); replace this null here with the lines of your code

;Question 8: Remainder of Peano numbers
; Input: M, N are pnums representing the integers m,n where n > 0
; Output: (rem M N) is the pnum representing the remainder of m divided by n
; Example: (rem seven three) would be one, i.e. (succ pzero), since (remainder 7 3) is 1.
; Requirement: your answer *must* be recursive to get credit since that is more efficient that calculating remainder = m - n*(quotient m n)

  null); replace this null here with the lines of your code
