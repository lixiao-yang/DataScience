## CS 270 Mathematical Foundations in Computer Science
SUMMER 23 <br>
3 credits

**Prof. Steve Earth <br>
Prof. Jeremy Johnson**

### Course Description
Introduces formal logic and its connections to Computer Science. Students learn to translate statements about the behavior of computer programs into logical claims and to prove such assertions using both traditional techniques and automated tools. Considers approaches to proving termination, correctness, and safety for programs. Discusses propositional and predicate logic, logical inference, recursion and recursively defined sets, mathematical induction, and structural induction.

### Course Objective and Goals
- use recursion and divide and conquer to solve problems
- provide recursive definitions of patterns and data structures
- formally specify the input/output requirements of programs
- use induction and other proof techniques to prove properties of algorithms, data structures, programs, and computer systems
- use logic to describe the state of systems and to use logical deduction (by hand and using tools) to prove properties of systems
- understand the power and limitations of formal logic.

### Course Topics
- Functional Programming
- Recursion, Recursive Definitions and Induction
- Propositional and Predicate Logic
- Formal Proof using Natural Deduction
- Applications of Logic to Computer Science
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms and Recurrence Relations
- Program Specification and Verification
- Automated Reasoning
- Test Case and Counter Example Generation
