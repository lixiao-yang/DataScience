## COURSE AND UNIVERSITY POLICIES  

- **Late Work**  
    Assignments that are more than three days late will not be accepted. Late projects will be docked 10% of the assignment value per day late.  

- **Plagiarism/Academic Honesty**  
    Plagiarism is the inclusion of someone’s previously documented words, ideas, or data in one’s own new and original work. When a student submits work for credit that includes the words, ideas, or data of others, including one’s own previously submitted work, the source of that information must be acknowledged through complete, accurate, and specific references, and, if verbatim statements are included, through quotation marks as well. Plagiarism covers unpublished as well as published sources. Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:

    - Quoting another person’s actual words, complete sentences or paragraphs, or an entire piece of written work without acknowledgment of the source.
    - Using another person’s ideas, opinions, or theory, even if it is completely paraphrased in one’s own words without acknowledgment of the source.
    - Borrowing facts, statistics, or other illustrative materials that are not clearly common knowledge without acknowledgment of the source. 
    - Copying, or allowing another student to copy, a computer file that contains another student’s assignment, and submitting it, in part or in its entirety, as one’s own.
    - Working together on an assignment, sharing the computer files and programs involved, and then submitting individual copies of the assignment as one’s own individual work.  
    
    Students are urged to consult with individual faculty members, academic departments, or recognized handbooks in their field if in doubt regarding issues of plagiarism.  
    For further information on Drexel University’s academic integrity policies and resources, please consult the following university web pages: [Academic Integrity Policy](www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic-integrity) and [Student Code of Conduct](https://drexel.edu/studentlife/community-standards/code-of-conduct).

- **Classroom Behavior**  

    - Peer Review: On several occasions, we will engage in peer reviews. This activity is considered crucial to the learning process. You are encouraged to offer constructive feedback to assist your peer review partners in enhancing their work.  
    
    - Blackboard Learn: This course will use Blackboard Learn. Course materials, assignment guidelines, and other related information will be posted on Blackboard. Please note that it is your responsibility to check Blackboard regularly for course-related updates and materials.  
    
    - Common Netiquette Rules    
    While this course is online, it mirrors a traditional classroom environment, expecting all participants to uphold responsible and respectful communication standards. This includes staying up-to-date with Blackboard Announcements, course readings, and class assignments; responding to emails in a reasonable timeframe (for non-urgent issues, please respond within 48 hours); and demonstrating respect for both your classmates and the instructor. Below are some specific guidelines to follow:

        - Keep your messages concise and clear by using short, to-the-point paragraphs.  
        - TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING ON THE INTERNET  
        - Messages written entirely in lowercase can be hard to read, so apply regular capitalization rules.  
        - *Asterisks* surrounding a word can be used to make a stronger point. 
        - Be careful when using sarcasm and humor. Without the benefit of face-to-face context, your joke may be interpreted as criticism. When using humor, you can use emoticons to express humor, but please use them *with moderation*  
    
    - Email Communication: I will regularly communicate with you via email and Blackboard. Please ensure your email is active, capable of receiving new messages, and that you check it daily. You are responsible for reading all emails I send. If you need to reply to group e-mails sent through Blackboard, please initiate a new message to me at hp484@drexel.edu. Include your course and section number in the subject line (e.g.,. COM310: Title). Every class-wide email will also be posted under “Announcements” section on Blackboard.

    It is the University's policy to provide a learning environment that provides all students with the opportunity to realize their full potential.

These requests are received by Disability Resources (DR), who then issues the AVL to the appropriate contacts. For additional information, visit the [Disability Resources](https://drexel.edu/oed/disabilityResources/overview/) web page, or contact DR for more information by phone at 215.895.1401, or by email at disability@drexel.edu.

If you are an international/multilingual student, the Center offers, in collaboration with the English Language Center (ELC) and the Drexel Library, a focused way to support you through their “Language, Writing, and Research” (LWR) Initiative.

    It is important to recognize that some or all of the course materials provided to you are the intellectual property of Drexel University, the course instructor, or others. Use of this intellectual property is governed by Drexel University policies, including the IT-1 policy found at: [https://drexel.edu/it/about/policies/policies/01-Acceptable-Use/](https://drexel.edu/it/about/policies/policies/01-Acceptable-Use/), this policy states that all course materials including recordings provided by the course instructor may not be copied, reproduced, distributed or re-posted, unless otherwise given prior written approval by the University. Doing so may be considered a breach of this policy and will be investigated and addressed as possible academic dishonesty, among other potential violations.

- **Recording of Class Activities**  

    In general, students and others should not record course interactions and course activities in lecture, lab, studio, or recitation. Students who have an approved accommodation from the Office of Disability Resources to record online lectures and discussions for note taking purposes should inform their course instructor(s) of their approved accommodation in advance. The recording of lectures and discussions may only be carried out by the students enrolled in the class who have an approved accommodation from Disability Resources with their instructors’ prior knowledge and consent. Students with approved accommodations may be asked to turn off their recorder if confidential or personal information is presented. If a student has any comments, concerns, or questions about provided class materials and/ or recording, talk to your course instructor first. If this does not resolve the issue, you can also reach out to the Department Head, and use the process described for a grade appeal to move your concern forward. The process described for grade appeals can be found at: [https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/grade-appeals/](https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/grade-appeals/)
