## Part I
### THE BASICS

#### Course Description:

INFO 215 introduces some of the social issues involved in information systems design and use, such as personal computing, telecommuting, computers in education, the privacy and security of stored and transmitted information, information ownership and copyright, and the interaction of high technology, employment, and class structure. When you have completed this course, you should be able to:

- Describe the concepts of the information society, the information industry, and the information profession, as a context for becoming familiar with a broad range of social, economic, political, and legal issues affecting information systems.

- Analyze interactions between emerging technologies and social systems.

- Analyze social, economic, political, and economic aspects of information systems. 

- Describe the societal context in which information professionals work.

#### Course Content:

The course includes lectures, discussions of readings, and interactive activities. Coursework involves: (a) reading and analyzing articles, blog posts, videos, and other assigned materials; (b) connecting these materials with your personal experiences; (c) completing written assignments, participating in in-class and out-of-class discussions and learning activities. Active participation is a key component of this course. This is a course about social issues, so you’re going to have to be social!

#### Course Readings:

There is no textbooks for this course. The readings listed on the schedule and any other announced in class will be available online or made available on Blackboard.

#### Grading:

The following items will contribute to your final grade:

- Assignment 1 25%  
- Assignment 2 25%
- Assignment 3 25%
- Weekly class attendance and participation 25%

Late adders are required to complete all assignments. 

Grades will be issued as letter grades following the Drexel grading scale:
https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/grades/

| Grade | Points | 
|---|---|
| A | 4.0 |
| A- | 3.67 |
| B+ | 3.33 |
| B | 3.0 |  
| B- | 2.67 |
| C+ | 2.33 |
| C | 2.0 |
| C- | 1.67 |
| D+ | 1.33 |
| D | 1.0 |
| F | 0.0 |


#### Grade Appeals:

To appeal a grade received on an assignment, submit a written (email) description of why you think the grade is in error. I will begin a review of the assignment in question and will re-grade the assignment from scratch. Please note: such a review process may result in a higher grade, the same grade, or a lower grade (if, for example, I find errors in content that I had not previously considered). 

#### Basic Grading Standards for Written Assignments:

A = Goes above mastery of facts and ideas presented in class and presents original ideas. Creatively synthesizes class readings and class discussions. Submitted materials are well-developed.

B = Demonstrates understanding of the course materials and ideas presented in class. Exhibits few miscomprehensions of course material, but presentation is somewhat less developed. 

C = Meets most expectations but some materials is miscomprehended, contains errors, or lacks significant depth of presentation. 

D = Misses or insufficiently addresses parts of the assignment.

F = Assignment is missing or plagiarized.

#### Readings:

Complete all readings and/or listening/viewing listed on the syllabus before the class date under which they’re listed. They’ll help you to understand the classes and provide you with meaningful content to contribute to class discussions and activities. You’ll also find the readings helpful for completing course assignments. You should use them as references for your assignments.

#### Assignments:

Read and follow all assignment instructions carefully. General formatting guidelines are presented below; specific formatting requirements are described in the Assignments document on Blackboard. Assignments will be turned in and graded once. Late assignments will be penalized by one full letter grade. 

Please submit all written assignments in PDF format. You can use whatever word-processing software you like (e.g., Overleaf, Word, Google Docs, etc.) to write assignments, but to avoid interoperability issues, please submit as PDFs. Before submitting your PDF, please check that is opens successfully in Adobe, Preview, or Firefox.

##### Writing
Your writing should be clear, concise, readable, and free from spelling and grammar errors. If English is not your first language, note this on your assignments, and I will take this into consideration. 

If you need or would like writing assistance, please contact Drexel Writing Center: 0032 MacAlister, 215.895.6633, www.drexel.edu/writincenter. They are open Mondays through Thursdays from 9am to 9pm, and on Fridays from 9am to 4pm.

##### Assignment formatting:
Unless otherwise specified in an individual assignment, written assignments should be formatted as follows:

- 12-pt font, standard font (e.g., Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, etc., etc. Note: serif fonts [e.g., Times New Roman] are generally better for prose.)
- 1-inch margins all around  
- Double-spaced

## CLASS POLICIES

#### Attendance and Participation

Participation is a critical aspect of this course and will constitute 25% of your grade. Regular class attendance is therefore required. But, as I said above, somethings things happen. As such, you may miss two classes without penalty. (Note: Please do not interpret this to mean, “Oh, cool, I can skip two classes just because I don’t feel like going.”) If you miss more than two classes, your participation grade will go down 1.25% points for each class missed.

Note: just showing up to class does not constitute full participation. You are expected to contribute to class discussion, take active part in small-group activities, and show active engagement with the material in order to receive an A for class participation. 

Every class includes material relevant to understanding social aspects of information systems. IF you miss a class, you can watch the recording and review the PowerPoint slides. However, viewing lectures/slides online and after the fact has no impact on your participation grade.

Late adders are required to complete all assignments and to be familiar with all course materials missed.  

#### Academic Honesty (Honestly...)

Any incidence of plagiarism or other academic dishonesty will result in an automatic F for the course. Do not plagiarize from anywhere, including articles, class handouts, other students, websites, work you have submitted to other courses, etc. All work you turn in must be your own original work for this course. Quotes from others’ work must be properly cited.  

Any assignment that includes plagiarized material, including using someone else’s work of your own work from another course, will result in course failure and reporting of the incident to the college and to the university. No excuses will be accepted. It’s up to you to be familiar with counts as plagiarism. Here are some suggested sources for understanding plagiarism:

- https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/teacher_and_tutor_resources/preventing_plagiarism/avoiding_plagiarism/index.html
- https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/avoiding-plagiarism

A note of explanation: I know that all of this stuff about plagiarism may seem draconian. But there are good reasons for it. First, people deserve credit for their work. It is not ethical to submit someone else’s work, or even the work of an AI text generator, as your own. Second, think about it: you’re here, you’re paying to be here in order to attain some kind of self-improvement (e.g., a broader worldview, viability on the job market, etc.). It just doesn’t make sense that waste an opportunity you’re paying for by cheating. To quote The Beatles, “The love you take is equal to the love you make.” In other words, you get what you give. I have found this to be true in every good-faith situation I’ve ever been in. I do understand the occasionally tremendous pressure that students feel to get “great” grades. If you find yourself weighed down by that pressure to such an extent that it is untenable, I would encourage you to take advantage of any number of the well-being resources that Drexel makes available to its students. Do your best. That’s all anyone can reasonably expect of you.

A note about collaborative work: Studying together or providing one another feedback on assignments is not dishonest; in fact, it is highly encouraged! If you want to work with a partner on your assignments, that’s fine. You’ll both receive the same grade on the assignment.

#### Drexel Academic Integrity Policy:
https://drexel.edu/studentlife/community_standards/code-of-conduct/academic-integrity-policy/

#### Add/Drop Policy:
University policies apply: https://drexel.edu/policies/policy/Course-Add-Drop/

#### Course Withdrawal:  
University policies apply: https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-withdrawal/

#### Course Communications:
Blackboard and your official university email address will be used for all course communication. You are responsible for the correct submission of your work via Blackboard.

#### Incompletes:
Incomplete grades for the term will be issued at the professor’s discretion and will be issued only in extreme cases, after the student has worked with the professor to try to complete the work during the term. Incompletes will be given only to students whose completed coursework has been qualitatively satisfactory, but who are unable to complete all course requirements because of serious illness or other extenuating circumstances beyond their control.

Students should notify the professor via email as soon as they realize they are having trouble completing work on time. Note that the decision whether or not to allow an incomplete is up to the professor, not the student, and can only be issued if at least 70% of all coursework has already been turned in. 

University policies apply: https://drexel.edu/provost/policies/incomplete_grades/

#### Course Evaluations:
Course evaluations will be available online toward the end of the term. Please complete them since they serve an important role in improving the quality of education at Drexel. (Pro Tip: Please avoid trivial comments. Examples of trivial comments I’ve received in the past: “Seberger should wear his hair down more.” Such comments are not only unproductive, but they’re also super uncomfortable.)

#### Provisions for Students with Disabilities: 
Students requesting accommodations due to a disability at Drexel University need to request a current Accommodations Verification Letter (AVL) in the ClockWork database before accommodations can be made. These requests are received by Disability Resources (DR), who then issues the AVL to the appropriate contacts. For additional information please consult: https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/about/overview/. DR can be contacted by phone at 215.895.1401, or by email at disability@drexel.edu.
