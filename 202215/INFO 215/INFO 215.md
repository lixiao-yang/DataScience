College of Computing and Informatics <br>
Drexel University<br>
Fall 2022<br>
Time: Tuesdays & Thursdays, 5:00pm – 6:20pm Eastern<br>
Classroom: 3675 Market St., Rm. # 1056<br>

**Instructor**: John S. Seberger
## THE BASICS
### Course Description
INFO 215 introduces some of the social issues involved in information systems design and use, such as personal computing, telecommuting, computers in education, the privacy and security of stored and transmitted information, information ownership and copyright, and the interaction of high technology, employment, and class structure. When you have completed this course, you should be able to:
- Describe the concepts of the information society, the information industry, and the information profession, as a context for becoming familiar with a broad range of social, economic, political, and legal issues affecting information systems.
- Analyze interactions between emerging technologies and social systems.
- Analyze social, economic, political, and economic aspects of information systems.
- Describe the societal context in which information professionals work.

### Course Content
The course includes lectures, discussions of readings, and interactive activities. Coursework involves: 
1. reading and analyzing articles, blog posts, videos, and other assigned materials;
2. connecting these materials with your personal experiences;
3. completing written assignments, participating in in-class and out-of-class discussions and learning activities. Active participation is a key component of this course. This is a course about social issues, so you’re going to have to be social!

### Course Readings
There is no textbooks for this course. The readings listed on the schedule and any other announced in class will be available online or made available on Blackboard.

### Grading:
The following items will contribute to your final grade:
- Assignment 1 25%
- Assignment 2 25%
- Assignment 3 25%
- Weekly class attendance and participation 25%<br>
Late adders are required to complete all assignments.

## CLASS POLICIES
### Attendance and Participation
Participation is a critical aspect of this course and will constitute 25% of your grade. Regular class attendance is therefore required. But, as I said above, somethings things happen. As such, you may miss two classes without penalty. (Note: Please do not interpret this to mean, “Oh, cool, I can skip two classes just because I don’t feel like going.”) If you miss more than two classes, your participation grade will go down 1.25% points for each class missed. <br>
Note: just showing up to class does not constitute full participation. You are expected to contribute to class discussion, take active part in small-group activities, and show active engagement with the material in order to receive an A for class participation.<br>
Every class includes material relevant to understanding social aspects of information systems. IF you miss a class, you can watch the recording and review the PowerPoint slides. However, viewing lectures/slides online and after the fact has no impact on your participation grade.Late adders are required to complete all assignments and to be familiar with all course materials missed.

### Academic Honesty (Honestly…)
Any incidence of plagiarism or other academic dishonesty will result in an automatic F for the course. Do not plagiarize from anywhere, including articles, class handouts, other students, websites, work you have submitted to other courses, etc. All work you turn in must be your own original work for this course. Quotes from others’ work must be properly cited.Any assignment that includes plagiarized material, including using someone else’s work of your own work from another course, will result in course failure and reporting of the incident to the college and to the university. No excuses will be accepted. It’s up to you to be familiar with counts as plagiarism. Here are some suggested sources for understanding plagiarism:
- https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/teacher_and_tutor_resources/preventing_plagiarism/avoiding_plagiarism/index.html
- https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/avoiding-plagiarism<br>
**A note of explanation**: I know that all of this stuff about plagiarism may seem draconian. But there are good reasons for it. First, people deserve credit for their work. It is not ethical to submit someone else’s work, or even the work of an AI text generator, as your own. Second, think about it: you’re here, you’re paying to be here in order to attain some kind of self-improvement (e.g., a broader worldview, viability on the job market, etc.). It just doesn’t make sense that waste an opportunity you’re paying for by cheating. To quote The Beatles, “The love you take is equal to the love you make.” In other words, you get what you give. I have found this to be true in every good-faith situation I’ve ever been in. I do understand the occasionally tremendous pressure that students feel to get “great” grades. If you find yourself weighed down by that pressure to such an extent that it is untenable, I would encourage you to take advantage of any number of the well-being resources that Drexel makes available to its students. Do your best. That’s all anyone can reasonably expect of you.

A note about collaborative work: Studying together or providing one another feedback on assignments is not dishonest; in fact, it is highly encouraged! If you want to work with a partner on your assignments, that’s fine. You’ll both receive the same grade on the assignment.
