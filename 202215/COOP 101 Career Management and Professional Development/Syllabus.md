## Welcome!

The COOP 101 faculty strive to make our learning community open and welcoming to all identities.  

COOP 101 prepares students for their co-op job experience with skill development, Steinbright policies and workplace awareness.  

Diversity of all kinds is valued in COOP 101 and students are encouraged to share their unique life experiences in class discussions and bring their strengths and challenges to our work. Co-op students are the industry leaders of tomorrow. We meet students where they are to provide thorough, thoughtful, and inclusive co-op preparation, which positions them for future success.

## I. COURSE REQUIREMENTS

COOP 101 prepares students for their co-op job experience.  

Course discussions and topics include: resume development, identification of career goals, job search strategies and resources, Interview preparation and practice, workplace success tips and diversity in the workplace

Successful completion of COOP 101 is required to participate in the Drexel co-op program.

There are 3 course requirements:

1. Attendance (40%)

Attendance at all classes will be monitored and each class is worth 4 points. You will be responsible for keeping track of your attendance status and how it affects your grade.

Please note: The goal of COOP 101 is to prepare you for a successful work experience. Punctuality and consistently showing up for work and class are your responsibility. Thus, you must arrive on time, sign-in yourself, and attend the entire class period to earn full points. Points will be deducted or lateness to class as well as absence.

Missing Class: If you need to miss class, you must “call in”/contact me IN ADVANCE and request to be given an alternative written assignment to earn points for that class. Alternative assignments will take approximately one hour and must be completed within 48-hours of that week’s class meeting time (no late work accepted). Number of alternative assignments granted will be limited as this is not an alternative to regular class attendance.

2. Resume Assignment (30%)

Resumes will be assessed based on content, structure, syntax, and presentation. Required content areas include but are not limited to: contact information, education, relevant coursework, skills, experience and activities. Additionally, factors such as format, style, spelling, and grammar are also important for a quality resume.

The completed resume is due by the start of your scheduled class time Week 4!

Students are encouraged to create their resumes using Drexel’s SCDConline internal resume template. Some students prefer to use an external software to create the resume template/design. Note, if you use an external software, you will be held to the same criteria as those using the internal template.

3. Class Assignments (30%)

Assignments due dates are included in the course outline chart below. After the due date and time (start of class period for most assignments), the assignment will be considered late. Late class assignments will only be eligible half credit max (5 out of 10 points) and can only be submitted within one week of the due date and time. Assignments submitted more than one week late will receive zero points.

Internet troubles or problems with technology do not constitute an excuse for submitting an assignment past the deadline; so do NOT procrastinate and make sure you get your work in well BEFORE the deadline. This will be the expectation in the workplace as well, so prepare now.

Students must complete three assignments in addition to the resume:

1. Job Description (Due by Start of Class Week 5)

2. LinkedIn Profile (Due by Start of Class Week 7) 

3. Video Resource Reflection (Due by Tuesday 11/22 at 5:00 PM)

4. Required Class Materials

There is no required text for the class. Please plan to bring a laptop or a tablet with comprehensive software applications to class to participate in class activities/work.

## II. GRADING

*All students will receive 4 points for week 10

## III. COURSE OUTLINE 

The specific course content including assignments is subject to change by the instructor during the term. Any changes will be made known to students as soon as possible with an updated syllabus posted on Learn.

## V. IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Academic Integrity: Dishonesty/Falsification of Information

Participation in this course is guided by the university’s policy on Academic Integration:

http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic_dishonesty.asp

Insufficient COOP 101 Grade

Receiving an insufficient grade will result in the following:

- You will be automatically registered for and must pass COOP 101 during the next term in which the course is offered prior to participating in your first co-op

- A Career Block Hold will be placed on your Drexel SCDC account, and as a result you will not have access to SCDConline for your job search until you receive a passing grade AND you will not be able to register a co-op job found through a self-directed job search

If you have previously failed COOP 101 your eligibility to participate in co-op may be affected (co-op cycle may be removed), significant financial aid and billing issues may occur, and/or graduation may be delayed or prevented.

Dropping or Withdrawing from COOP 101

You have been registered for this course, when possible, at least three terms before your assigned co-op cycle. This timing is deliberately designed to support your co-op job search. Thus, dropping or withdrawing from this course in the term you are assigned is not advised without compelling circumstances. Please contact your instructor immediately if you have concerns about your registration.

Please contact your Academic Advisor to drop the course,

http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-add-drop

or to withdraw 

http://drexel.edu/provost/policies/course-withdrawal,

as COOP 101 is not accessible through Drexel Learn. It is important to note the grading policy concerning withdrawing from the course.

Any student with a documented disability and needing accommodations is encouraged to contact the instructor as soon as possible (preferably within the first week of class). All discussions will remain confidential. For additional information, refer to: http://drexel.edu/oed/disabilityResources/students/
