# English 111-008: English Composition I
Fall Quarter 2022

**Instructor: Margene L. Petersen** <br>
**Section: ENGL 111-008**<br>
Class days/times: T/TH 10:00-11:50am Lincoln Plaza 325. Bring Drexel I.D.	<br>

## Course Description
Develops multilingual (ESL) students' abilities to use writing as a tool for research and reflection. Introduces the concept of genre, writing as a process, reflection on students’ own and others’ work, revision, and approaches to primary and secondary research. Reviews grammar, organization, style, and documentation conventions. Promotes positive attitudes toward writing.

## Course Purpose
In the First-Year Writing Program, we focus on two of the Drexel Student Learning Priorities: communication and self-directed learning. We encourage students to write dearly with a firm sense of their readers-the people with whom they are communicating. We believe that when writers connect with their readers about subjects of real concern to the writers, they will more readily continue to learn and practice writing on their own, an attitude we believe is fundamental to improving one's writing. As a result, our students will use writing effectively in their personal, academic, and professional lives

## Learning Outcomes and Objectives
In English 111, students will be able to:<br>
-	use writing to explore students’ experiences and ideas.
-	demonstrate understanding of the basic functions of genres: memoir, profile, reflection.
-	 respond productively to classmates’ writing.
-	improve grammar and mechanics.
-	carry out and value primary research (interviews and surveys) as well as secondary research (library and Internet).
-	develop a more positive attitude towards writing

Informal writing assignments are an important component of your grade in this course. Each week, you will be required to write several hundred words in response to readings, professor questions, and ongoing discussion of your projects. In addition, we will use informal writing for regular discussion of grammar and mechanics. These informal writings may include discussion threads on Blackboard Learn, blogs, notebooks, journals, peer reviews, and in-class writings.

## Course Policies and Resources

### Class Participation and Attendance
Your participation is essential to your success in this class.  Class participation means being present and prepared, and actively engaging with discussion, readings, and writing. Students who miss more than 10% of class meetings due to unexcused absences will have their grades reduced. Except under extraordinary circumstances, a student who misses more than 20% of scheduled class time as a result of unexcused OR excused absences will fail the course. An excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student’s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or essential travel; an official university event (e.g., academics, athletics or performing arts); or a religious holiday. <br>
Being on time is also important. Students who are often late to class may be marked absent at their instructor’s discretion.

## Descriptions of Major Projects
### Composition Project 1: Literacy Narrative
For this assignment, you may choose to write in either of two genres: Literacy Narrative 
or Memoir. Please review the chapters, choose a topic, and write a draft week 3. Members of the class will share their ideas, and the final version will be due Week 5. Approximate length: 750-1000 words.
 
As you draft and revise, utilize peer review feedback, instructor’s office hours, The Drexel Writing Center, The English Language Center, and Language, Writing, and Research Consultations.

### Composition Project 2: Profile

One of the goals of this course is for us to begin doing primary research. Using the guidelines for conducting primary research, write a profile of an interesting person you know or whom you will meet and interview. You will also include a secondary source to support your subject.  Members of the class will share their ideas, and the final version will be due Week 10. Approximate length: 1,000-1,200 words. 

Review the guidelines in the “Creating Knowledge using Primary Research” section in the OER https://drexel0.sharepoint.com/sites/COAS-FirstYearWritingResources/SitePages/creating-knowledge.aspx 

Include at least one secondary source in addition to your primary research. Review the OERs in the section on “Finding and Responding to Secondary Sources” https://drexel0.sharepoint.com/sites/COAS-FirstYearWritingResources/SitePages/finding-and-responding-to-texts.aspx 


As you draft and revise, utilize peer review feedback, instructor’s office hours, The Drexel Writing Center, The English Language Center, and Language, Writing, and Research Consultations.


 
### Composition Project 3 – Reflective Analysis

This final paper will help you reflect on yourself as a writer, the changes in your attitude to writing (if any), and the progress you made in ENGL 111. Reflective analysis helps you to make an evidence-based argument about yourself, a skill that will benefit you not only here at Drexel, but also outside of Drexel. In your personal, academic, and professional life, it will be important to establish and reflect on goals, to periodically examine what you have accomplished, and to ask critical questions about your learning: What did I hope to accomplish in this class/project/ experience? How did I grow as a person, scholar, or professional? What evidence do I have for that growth? How does this growth prepare me for what is next?
Minimal length: 600 words.
Components of the Reflective Analysis
Your Reflective Analysis should accomplish four tasks:
1.	It should make an argument about your writing development.
2.	It should use artifacts of your own writing as evidence for your argument. Specifically:
    a.	2 major projects from 111
    b.	2 informal writings from 111
     c.	Any other supporting artifacts you would like to use
3.	It should do “meta-analysis” of those artifacts as it makes its argument. “Meta-analysis” is your examination of your own work, your writing-about-your-writing. 
4.	It should be directed to a specific audience: Professional employer, friend, teacher, parent or guardian, future child, yourself…you choose. The format should fit the audience.

Review “Reflecting on Your Writing Process” section in the OER https://drexel0.sharepoint.com/sites/COAS-FirstYearWritingResources/SitePages/reflecting-on-your-writing-process.aspx   

### Citing Your Own Writing:
In your Reflective Analysis, you should, of course, provide proper in-text citation of your sources, just as you would with any other source in a composition; so, you’ll be citing yourself. Here is an example:

In my second project for English 111, I discuss the impact of drafting on my writing development: “I have always drafted because I have been required to. But I really wanted to reflect analytically on how the process of drafting actually impacted my overall writing development. Was I becoming a ‘better’ writer?” (“Drafting and Development” 1).

Additionally, you should include full citations in a Works Cited. Here’s how: 

### Works Cited
Last name, First name. “Title of Project.” Course Title. Professor ______ _______. Department,
Institution. Date project was submitted. 

### Keep in Mind
Your reflection is not a place to try to make your professor feel good about your growth as a writer; it is a space for your honest reflection about you and your own work. 

As you draft and revise, utilize peer review feedback, instructor’s office hours, The Drexel Writing Center, The English Language Center, and Language, Writing, and Research Consultations.
