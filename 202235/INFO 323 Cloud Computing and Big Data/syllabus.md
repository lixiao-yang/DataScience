Covers concepts of scalable data analysis, predictive modeling, and graph analysis through specific cloud computing platforms. Introduces the components and tools in cloud computing ecosystems associated with big data solutions as well as NoSQL databases. Through hands-on instructions and assignments, students will develop working knowledge of practical tools and strategies of processing massive data sets using the map/reduce framework and Apache Spark.

## Curriculum Role
This course is a core course for the Data Science major and an elective for the Data Science minor.

## Course Rationale  
This course helps students develop a set of skills for processing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful information from large amounts of complex data sets using the technologies related to cloud computing.

## Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:

- Explain the important concepts of cloud computing for solving fundamental big data problems such as scalable processing, transformation, and analysis.
- Identify the specific components and basic processes of the cloud computing architecture, software stack, and execution environment. 
- Design, implement, and execute tasks in the map/reduce framework, and explain the trade-offs in map/reduce and how that motivates other tools.
- Query and explore data using higher-level tools built on top of a cloud computing platform.  
- Demonstrate working knowledge of practical tools for processing massive data sets.
- Carry out basic scalable big data analysis and explain key elements for applying advanced analytics, predictive modeling, or graph analysis to real world problems. 
- Understand recent developments in big data technologies such as Spark and NoSQL databases

## Grading
Your course grade will be based on: course participation, homework assignments, team project, and exams. The grade is computed as follows:

| Task | Weight | Due |
|-|-|-|
| Course Participation and Exercises | 20% | Week 1-10 |   
| Assignment 1 | 10% | Week 2 |
| Assignment 2 | 10% | Week 4 |
| Midterm | 20% | Week 5 |
| Assignment 3 | 10% | Week 7 |  
| Assignment 4 | 10% | Week 10 |
| Project Proposal | 5% | Week 8 |
| Course Project | 15% | Week 10-11 |

All work is graded on a numeric scale of 0 to 100. Assignments are graded based on their content (whether you answered the questions correctly and well) and their form (did you produce a submission that has a professional appearance that follows course requirements). A single grade is computed for the assignment based on those two factors.

Conversion from points to letters:

| Points | Letter Grade |
|-|-|
| >=99 | A+ |
| 93-98 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B | 
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |  
| 70-72 | C- |
| 67-69 | D+ |
| 63-66 | D |
| <=62 | F |

## Exam and Project  

There will be one exam and one final project in this course. Tentatively, the midterm exam will be held in week 5, and the final project is due at the end of the course. The specific dates and the format of the exam and project will be announced in class.

## Final Project
The final projects must be proposed and developed by student groups each of which consisting of up to 3 students. Each team must obtain an approval from the instructor for their proposed project. Unapproved projects will be graded as zero when weighed in the final grade.

## Submitting Assignments  

1. You must submit assignments electronically via Blackboard Learn no later than 11:59pm on the due day. The name(s) and student ID(s) of all submitters of the assignment along with the course number and assignment number must be clearly printed on the first page.  
2. University rules and policies regarding academic honesty are followed to the letter.  

## Late or Missing Work

Each item of course work you turn in has a due date and time:

- Deliverables are due at the time and date indicated by instructions. Written assignments are due no later than 11:59pm on the due day.
- There will be a 10% (absolute value) deduction for each day of lateness, to a maximum of 3 days; assignments will not be accepted beyond that point. Missing work will earn a zero grade.  

## Re-Marking  

If you are dissatisfied with a grade or point deduction, you can request re-marking. All re-marking requests must be done through written (paper or email) descriptions of why you think the grade is in error. 

## Academic Honesty  

The Drexel University Academic Honesty Rules and Procedures (as stated in the student handbook) will be adhered to strictly. Students who commit plagiarism or cheat on assignments may receive an F grade for both the assignment and the course.

## Class Attendance and Participation  

You will get the most out of this course if you come to class on time, participate and conduct yourself in a professional manner. Skipping classes will hinder your ability to do well in the course and to learn this important subject. You will also miss handouts, assignments, and announcements.  

Participation in class is important; there are no stupid questions or comments.  

Class attendance is expected. Attendance includes arriving when the class is scheduled to start and staying for the duration of the class period. Roll may be taken in this course and you are expected to acknowledge your attendance at least 90% of the time that attendance is taken in the course. I reserve the right to lower any earned course grade if a student fails to meet attendance requirements.  

## Disabilities  

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations and services at Drexel University need to present a current accommodation verification letter (“AVL”) to faculty before accommodations can be made. AVL’s are issued by the Office of Dis
