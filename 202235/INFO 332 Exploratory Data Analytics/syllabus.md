## Catalog Description
In this course students learn the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing and analyzing data. The course discusses how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment. It covers practical issues in statistical computing, which includes programming in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. The course covers the plotting systems in R and some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics.

## Curriculum Role
This course is a core course for the Data Science major and an elective for Data Science minor.

## Course Rationale
This course teaches students to use a statistical programming environment for exploring and summarizing data. Students will acquire the skills and techniques that are typically applied before building formal models.

## Course Outcomes 
Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:
- Install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment.
- Describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language.
- Write programs in R, including reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code.
- Apply exploratory and statistical analysis to medium size data sets including plotting the data and creating data graphics.
- Describe potential hypotheses about an application that can be addressed by an exploratory analysis on relevant data sets.

## Grading

Your course grade will be based on: DataCamp assignments, homework assignments, and exams. The grade is computed as follows:

| Task | Weight | Points | Frequency |
|-|-|-|-|
| Class Attendance | 10% | 20 | Once a week |
| DataCamp Modules | 10% | 20 | 8 DataCamp assignments (about 1 each week) |
| Quizzes | 20% | 40 | 8 Quizzes (about 1 each week) |
| Assignments | 20% | 40 | 3 Assignments (distributed over course) |
| Midterm | 20% | 40 | 1 Midterm |
| Final | 20% | 40 | 1 Final |
| Total | 100% | 200 points | |

All work is graded on a numeric scale of 0 to 100. Assignments are graded based on their content (whether you answered the questions correctly and well) and their form (did you produce a submission that has a professional appearance that follows course requirements). A single grade is computed for the assignment based on those two factors.

Conversion from points to letters:

| Points | Letter Grade |
|-|-|
| >=97 | A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| 67-69 | D+ |
| 63-66 | D |
| <=62 | F |

## Exams
There will be two exams in this course. Tentatively, the midterm exam will be held in week 5, the final exam at the end of the course. The specific dates and the format of the exams will be announced in class.

## Submitting Assignments
1. You must submit assignments electronically via Blackboard Learn no later than 11:59pm on the due day. The name(s) and student ID(s) of all submitters of the assignment along with the course number and assignment number must be clearly printed on the first page.
2. University rules and policies regarding academic honesty are followed to the letter.

## Late or Missing Work
Each item of course work you turn in has a due date and time:
- Deliverables are due at the time and date indicated by instructions. Written assignments are due no later than 11:59pm on the due day.
- There will be a 10% (absolute value) deduction for each day of lateness, to a maximum of 3 days; assignments will not be accepted beyond that point. Missing work will earn a zero grade.

## Re-Marking
If you are dissatisfied with a grade or point deduction, you can request re-marking. All re-marking requests must be done through written (paper or email) descriptions of why you think the grade is in error. Please note that it is very rare that changing disputed grades on assignments or exams actually affects a student's calculated letter course grade. The corrections are usually insignificant. If you wish to appeal a course grade, school policies apply.

## Academic Honesty
The Drexel University Academic Honesty Rules and Procedures (as stated in the student handbook) will be adhered to strictly. Students who commit plagiarism or cheat on assignments may receive an F grade for both the assignment and the course.

Academic Dishonesty Policy: http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/academic_dishonesty.asp

In order to avoid plagiarizing material, observe the following:
- If you work on an assignment with another student or a group of students, be certain that your final, individual paper is your own work or the work of your project group (for group projects) unless otherwise specified by the professor. While you might want to discuss the assignment with other students, you must, in your paper, express your own ideas in your own way.
- If you use printed or electronic resources in your papers, be sure to attribute the sources you have used. This can be done by quoting the material or by paraphrasing the material and, in either case, listing the source in an annotated bibliography. Use standard notation when citing references.

## Class Attendance and Participation
This is an online course. No class attendance is required. However, students are highly encouraged to participate in class through the official Discussions Board organized by week/topic. Asking questions, reporting errata, engaging in discussions with peers are all activities that are highly appreciated and will be rewarding to all participants. In addition, virtual or face-to-face meetups with the course Instructor might be held on several occasions during the course. This will be announced on the Discussions Board and will be subject to availability of students and Instructor.

## Disabilities
Students with disabilities requesting accommodations and services at Drexel University need to present a current accommodation verification letter ("AVL") to faculty before accommodations can be made. 

AVL's are issued by the Office of Disability Services ("ODS"). For additional information, contact the ODS at www.drexel.edu/edt/disability, 3201 Arch St., Ste. 210, Philadelphia, PA 19104, Voice: 215.895.1401, or TTY 215.895.2299.

## Withdrawal 
For dropping or withdrawing from the course, please refer to the university policies at:
http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_drop.asp
http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/course_withdrawal_policy.asp

## Incomplete Policy
Incomplete grades are contingent upon instructor approval and will only be considered in extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control. The instructor is under no obligation to offer an incomplete grade. At least 80% of the graded coursework must have already been completed in order for an incomplete grade to be considered (per the recommendation of the Provost's Office). An incomplete contract with an instructor-determined due date for delivery of the completed work must be completed by the student and the instructor. It can be found here: http://www.drexel.edu/provost/policies/pdf/forms/incomplete.pdf.

## Support for Equality and Diversity 
Drexel University strives to promote an environment of equality of opportunity and compliance with University policies and federal, state and local laws prohibiting discrimination based upon race, color, religion, gender (sex), marital status, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability and veteran status. Students, faculty, and staff with questions about or complaints concerning discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation should contact the Office of Equality and Diversity at (215) 895-1403 or http://www.drexel.edu/oed/
