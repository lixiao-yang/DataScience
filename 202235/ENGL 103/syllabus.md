Dr. Lisa DiMaio

Classroom: Curtis 250A

## **Commitment to Linguistic Diversity and Inclusive and Equitable Pedagogies**

Students in our class may represent a variety of linguistic backgrounds. If you use English as an additional language, you are invited to write in your first language whenever it is helpful (such as in first drafts and notes), to use vocabulary that do not have translations in English, to use sources that are written in your first language, and to conduct primary research in your first language. I am committed to facilitating your learning, and along that journey, I will respect your voice and identity and value your linguistic differences.

If you use English as a first language, please know that in this classroom, multilingual writers are to be treated with respect. Their feedback during peer review is to be valued, their voices during class discussions are to be invited and heard, and "written accent" is to be respected. We want everyone's point to be heard, understood, and shared with others in a way that is authentic.  

In addition, my hope is that your learning in this course will contribute to making our campus community a more welcoming and supportive space where you and all people of all genders and sexualities feel they belong.

Sincerely,

Dr. Lisa

## **Course Description**

Teaches terminology and rhetorical strategies of writing analytically about a theme (in this course: Identity, Race, and Culture) as it appears in a variety of genres. Advances students' development in the writing and research processes, in their rhetorical awareness of images and design, and in their understanding of how genres of writing (poetry, drama, fiction, nonfiction argumentative, investigative, academic, business, reportorial) shape meaning.

### **Major Projects**  

You will have three major composition projects in this course.  Specific assignments and due dates are listed in the "Descriptions of Major Projects" section below and on Learn.

## **Course Policies and Resources**   

### **Class Participation and Attendance**  

It is important that you attend every class session. Otherwise, you will miss out on the many learning activities that we will engage in. [Class participation means being present and prepared--- and actively engaging in our class discussions, the readings, and writing.]{.mark}  

Missing more than 10% of class meetings due to unexcused absences will result in reduced grades. Missing more than 20% of class time can result in failing the course. An excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student's control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or essential travel; an official university event (e.g., academics, athletics or performing arts); or a religious holiday. Please reach out to me if you need an excused absence; I understand that sickness and emergencies happen!  

Being on time is also important. If you're *often* late to class, I may mark you absent. If you're coming from a building across campus, just let me know you might be a few minutes late to our class.   

### **Laptops**  

Our class will make extensive use of BbLearn. We will do a great deal of writing during the class period, so it will be necessary for you to bring a laptop to class.  

### **Add/Drop/Withdraw**

You will have until the end of the 1st week to add or drop a course. Please note that you are responsible for any work you miss in the late addition of a course.

Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and bring different strengths and needs to the class. If there are aspects of the course that prevent you from learning or make you feel excluded, please let me know as soon as possible. Together, we'll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.  

If you have a disability and require accommodations, please let me know as soon as possible. You will need to register with the Office of Disability Resources. Then you will need to present a current accommodation verification letter (AVL) to me so I can implement the accommodations. AVLs are issued by the Office of Disability Resources (ODR).

## **Descriptions of Major Projects**  

### **Assignment 1:**  

Choose an **artifact** that symbolizes something about **your** **identity, culture, or race** to which you belong. This might be a physical object, such as a religious symbol, a traditional clothing item, etc., that you have, or it may be a metaphorical object, such as Du Bois' "color line" or "veil," that **represents something larger about your identity, culture, or race.** Be sure to use sensory details and explain its meaning both to you personally and within a larger context (i.e. the LGBTQIA+ community; the Spanish culture; your family; your religious community, etc.) Also, use at least two primary or secondary sources to describe the background of the physical or metaphorical artifact.

Length: 800-1000 words  

***As you draft and revise, utilize peer feedback, my feedback, my office hours, and The Drexel Writing Center.***

### Assignment 2:

Write a review of a specific film, TV series, podcast, play, or video game that you think contributes something significant to its genre and to the culture at large. Show how the subject---the primary source---of your review illustrates something **compelling or exceptional about a particular idea or theme c**ommon to the genre. Use specific evidence from your primary source to support a central idea, or thesis. Provide an **overall** **judgment** about your subject and support it with **evidence** from the primary source and **from secondary sources if applicable,** but not required. In addition, explore how your specific subject has contributed something significant to its genre. In other words, *why is this subject interesting, different, or worthy of analysis?* Be sure to demonstrate awareness of your source's cultural and historical context as well. For example, if your review is about a romantic comedy, provide relevant information about the history, conventions, or expectations of that genre.  

We will brainstorm evaluative criteria together in class and use the following chapter for guidance: <https://openstax.org/books/writing-guide/pages/7-5-writing-process-thinking-critically-about-entertainment#table-00001>

Length: 1000-1200 words  

***As you draft and revise, utilize peer feedback, my feedback, my office hours, and The Drexel Writing Center.***

### **Assignment 3:**  

What is a research question that you want to explore about *your* identity, race, and/or culture? We will brainstorm questions/ideas in class. This is a research paper, so you will need to incorporate at least four sources---primary or secondary, but at least two must be scholarly. We will refer to three readings in The 33^rd^ for guidance.  

Length: 1200-1500 words. ***As you draft and revise, utilize peer feedback, my feedback, my office hours, and The Drexel Writing Center.***
