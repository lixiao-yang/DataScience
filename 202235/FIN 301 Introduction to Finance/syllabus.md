## I. Course Overview  

This course covers the financial structure of a corporation, short-and long-term financial policies, sources and uses of capital funds, asset valuation, capital budgeting, and corporate growth.  

For Finance Majors, this course forms the foundation that subsequent Finance courses build on. The concepts and theories studied will be applied again in different settings and applications. Non-Finance majors will benefit by being exposed to basic financial concepts which can be useful for evaluating personal financial decisions.  

Statement of Expected Learning: Financial decision-making, whether it involves financial analysis, asset management and valuation, capital budgeting, capital structure considerations, or planning and forecasting is crucial to any business entity. This course focuses on the processes and methods by with such decisions are made. The student can expect to complete the course with a basic understanding of the financial aspects of running a business, the financial markets, and personal financial issues. Analytic problem-solving skills will be enhanced, and communication and critical thinking skills will be improved through group projects, discussions, and assignments.

Prerequisites: ACCT 110 or ACCT 115 or HRM 310 & STAT 201 or STAT 205 or STAT 261. It is the student’s responsibility to be certain that the prerequisites have been successfully completed.

## III. Evaluation  

| Assessment | Total available points | Percent of Grade |  
|-|-|-|
| Attendance | 200 | 20% |   
| Practice Problems | 200 | 20% |     
| Exam 1 | 200 | 20% |
| Exam 2 | 200 | 20% |  
| Final Project | 200 | 20% |
| Total | 1,000 | 100% |  

A sample Excel sheet is posted for you to keep up with your grades and understand the grading system. Grades are updated on BBLearn at least weekly. If you have questions or concerns about your grades, please contact me immediately.  

Attendance is earned each class. I reserve the right to take off points for being late or for violating the laptop / phone policy (see below). If you must miss class, contact me within 24 hours of class end to schedule make-up opportunities for attendance points.  

Practice Problems cover the most important material and help you practice. These assignments will be done in class. Use this to see where your weaknesses are, and what you do not understand. You are allowed to use reference material from the book, class notes, and the internet. It is also acceptable to consult with me and/or your classmates, but you must submit your own work. Due at the end of class on the indicated date. This implies that attending and following along in class is crucial. Submissions can be on paper during class or by emailing me notes from your tablet. Grading is based on effort. If you miss class, contact me within 24 hours of class end to schedule make-up opportunities.  

Exam 1 covers the fundamentals of Finance. You must solve problems by hand (no financial calculator, no Excel). You may not use any notes or cheat sheets.   

Exam 2 is cumulative and covers everything covered in class up to that point. You may use a single page of notes and a financial calculator, but no Excel.  

The project is very applied and may require some research on your own. It combines multiple topics and is meant to prepare you for real-life challenges. You will get to choose one out of two projects. The late submission penalty is 40 points per day. You are allowed to use reference material from the book, class notes, and the internet. It is also acceptable to consult with your classmates, but you must submit your own work. Due at the end of day on Sunday, June 4th. Submission of Excel / Google Sheet via BBLearn. EVEN GRADUATING SENIORS MUST COMPLETE THE PROJECT.  

Extra Credit will be available throughout the quarter at my discretion. I will share details throughout the quarter.  

Final Grades: Will be assigned according to the standard grade system:  

A+ 97-100; A 93-96; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+ 65-69; D 60-64; F Below 60  

Grades are rounded to the nearest integer. E.g. 89.4 → 89, but 89.50 → 90.  

Instructor Feedback and Email Policy: I attempt to return all work within 7 days. I reserve the right to take 24 hours to respond to emails during normal business days, and up to 72 hours on the weekend (e.g. an email on Friday night may not receive a response until Monday).  

## IV. General Policies  

Please be courteous and polite at all times. This includes coming to class on time and not leaving early. Not adhering to these policies may result in loss of participation credit or more drastic measures. For details, see also:

### Email Correspondence  

Students should check their Drexel email at least three (3) times per week for important course-related information. Students should only send questions to instructors from their Drexel email account and not from an external account (e.g. gmail). For security purposes, instructors are directed to not reply to student emails that come from non-Drexel email addresses. Please adhere to common courtesy rules – e.g. spelling my name correctly. When you have questions about assignments, be as specific as possible by explaining your thought process. Do not ask me to solve a problem for you.  

### Appropriate Use of Course Materials   

It is important to recognize that some or all of the course materials provided to you may be the intellectual property of Drexel University, the course instructor, or others. Use of this intellectual property is governed by Drexel University policies, including the IT-1 policy found at:  

https://drexel.edu/it/about/policies/policies/01-Acceptable-Use/  

Briefly, this policy states that all course materials including recordings provided by the course instructor may not be copied, reproduced, distributed or re-posted. Doing so may be considered a breach of this policy and will be investigated and addressed as possible academic dishonesty, among other potential violations. Improper use of such materials may also constitute a violation of the University’s Code of Conduct found at:  

https://drexel.edu/cpo/policies/cpo-1/ and will be investigated as such.  

### Cell phone / Laptop Policy  

Unless specifically stated otherwise (during a class where we use Excel), I do not allow open laptops during lecture. Exceptions are made for students with an AVL. Tablets are acceptable for note-taking. In addition, I ask that you use your phone like you would in a professional meeting – only when absolutely necessary. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in loss of attendance points.
