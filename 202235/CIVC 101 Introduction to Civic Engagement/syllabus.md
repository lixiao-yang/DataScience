## 1. University Commitment to Civic Engagement

Civic engagement unites communities and advances a more just society that benefits all people. Drexel is committed to becoming “the most civically engaged university in the United States,” according to President John A. Fry. This means the University strives to be a responsible community member and encourages all who study, research, and work here to be socially-conscious, global citizens who use their skills to address societal issues. One dimension of Drexel’s commitment is educating students on what it means to be an active, responsible citizen through community-engaged academic experiences, volunteering, and more.

## 2. Course Description

CIVC 101: Introduction to Civic Engagement is designed to be students’ introduction to civic engagement and what it means to be responsible, socially-conscious citizens of Philadelphia and the world. Students will explore the broad definition of civic engagement and critically examine concepts of identity, community, and systems to better understand social issues and build a foundation for making social change through civic engagement. As a community-engaged learning course, students will not only learn about these concepts in the classroom but also participate in volunteerism and other interactions with community and social issues. Throughout the course, students will reflect on their personal experiences and understanding of the world to tie together their learning and engagement and provide tools to advance their knowledge and practice beyond the course.

## 3. Course Learning Outcomes

Consistent with the mission and vision of the Lindy Center for Civic Engagement and the University’s strategic plan to produce students who are responsible citizens, below are the learning outcomes for this course. Student will be able to:

- Define civic engagement and community engagement and key concepts such as identity, community, and systems of power.

- Practice skills related to civic engagement (self-awareness, relationship building, dialogue, reflection, etc.).

- Deeply explore and act on a social issue of interest to them as part of a term-long project and be able to identify and critically examine additional social issues in class.

- Envision their own identity as an active, engaged, responsible citizen and recognize how effective individual and collective action can lead to social change. 

- Identify examples of power and privilege and be able to explain their impact in everyday life.

## 4. Course Structure 

Face-to-face courses combine asynchronous weeks, where students review material posted to BlackBoard Learn on their own time, and synchronous weeks where students will be expected to attend in-person classes during the scheduled class time to discuss materials from the previous week. The weekly breakdown is as follows:

- In odd weeks of the course (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), students will be expected to review content on your own time (asynchronously) in Learn, and that content must be reviewed before your scheduled course meeting time the following week. Content will include recorded lectures, supplemental materials such as videos and articles, and activities such as discussion board posts or surveys. In the following week’s in-person discussion, we will reference many of these materials, so we ask that you engage with them thoughtfully and bring any takeaways or questions to class.
  
- In week 1 and the following even weeks of the course (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), students will be expected to attend class in-person during the scheduled class time. These face-to-face sessions will be facilitated by your course instructor and Course Assistant using methods such as small groups, activities, large class discussions, and more. Discussions will pull in your takeaways and questions from the material you reviewed the previous week and introduce new discussion questions to consider and discuss. *If students are unable to attend an in-person meeting, they must notify the instructor as early as possible to work out an alternative plan or assignment. Your instructor will determine what counts as an excused versus unexcused absence but communication is key no matter what your situation.

- There will be four (4) required written journal entries due at the end of each even week (except week 10) where students will be asked to reflect on the previous two weeks of material—including the lesson in BBLearn and the in-class discussion. These should be submitted in Learn. 

- There will also be a term-long project that will ask you to deeply explore and act on a social issue that you find important. There will be deliverables due for this project throughout the term, including a final reflection at the end of the term. More details on this assignment will be shared early in the course by your instructor and/or CA.

Please note that the Lindy Center for Civic Engagement, the campus office that coordinates this course, is committed to providing you with the best possible experience in CIVC 101, a class that offers a unique opportunity to deeply engage with yourself and your classmates around social issues and what it means to create a more just world. We feel that the course’s curriculum, focused on critical reflection of identity and privilege, community, systems, and social issues, is extremely relevant in our current moment as the world deals with several crises and inequalities, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we hope that you all will find meaning in the course and take your participation seriously. We also realize that this is a difficult time for everyone in the Drexel community, so it is particularly important that you communicate any issues to your instructor, CA, or the Lindy Center as soon as possible so we can help you succeed.

## 5. Grading (based on 100-point scale)

Each student is responsible for fulfilling the requirements of this course, which include viewing and engaging with course materials in BBLearn, active participation in class discussions, and completing assignments such as reflection journal entries and the term-long project. These requirements are explained in further detail below.

**Engaging with course materials and class participation (50 points)**

Student participation in each two-week module (1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, and 9 and 10) is worth 10 points (50 total). The maximum number of points will be awarded to students who both access and thoughtfully engage with the asynchronous material in BBLearn and actively participate in class discussions, demonstrating that they have thought critically about the materials from the previous week.

**Reflection Journal Entries (20 points)**

Reflection journals are due at the end of every even week on Sunday at 11:59pm (with the exception of the last week of the term, as you will be working on your final reflection)—at the end of week 2, the journal entry should cover weeks 1 and 2; at the end of week 4, the journal entry should cover weeks 3 and 4; etc. These journal entries are open format but should be minimum 200 words and demonstrate both thoughtful analysis of the course materials from the odd week and personal reflections from the even week discussion. Journal entries are worth 5 points each (20 total).

**Term-Long Project (30 points)** 

The term-long project asks you to learn about, engage with, and reflect on a social issue that you personally find important. There will be deliverables due throughout the term—these will be outlined early in the term by your instructor/TA so you will know about them well in advance. Your instructor and/or TA will also describe the grading breakdown for the project (how much each deliverable will be worth totaling 30 points).

## 8. Statement of Classroom Community:

Community-Based Learning courses such as CIVC 101 are designed to help students build a foundation for civic action through:

- knowledge about specific communities, social issues, and ways to make social change
- engagement with individuals in these communities and those who experience social issues, and 
- reflection about what you are learning and experiencing, as well as your individual role in the communities and social issues presented and capacity to make social change.

The Lindy Center for Civic Engagement believes that we can only accomplish the above in a classroom community that is supportive, inclusive, and focused on respectful dialogue between students with diverse experiences and perspectives. Our staff, your instructor, and your Course Assistant work together to intentionally create this kind of classroom environment and we ask that you do the same by acting in accordance with these principles:

- **Mutual Respect and Non-violence:**
  - treat others who are sharing the way you would like them to treat you
  - contribute to an inclusive environment where individuals are treated fairly and have equal opportunity to participate and succeed
  - refrain from interrupting, shouting, verbally or physically attacking others, and violating people’s privacy
  - do not be accusatory or defensive, or deny others’ lived experience: it can be a real experience even if it hasn’t been yours
- **Emotional Intelligence:** 
  - manage your emotions rather than suppressing them – this includes recognizing the difference between drama (discomfort) and trauma (distress) and responding appropriately (lean into discomfort and name/report traumatic situations that you need to remove yourself from)
  - acknowledge your own biases, implicit and explicit
  - come to the discussion as your authentic self and do not shy away from vulnerability
  - let individuals be individuals, not representatives of whole social groups
- **Inquiry & Social Learning:**
  - enter the classroom with an open mind
  - ask non-leading questions, listen generously, and be willing to change your assumptions, beliefs, and values when presented with new information
  - discourage monopolizing conversations
  - allow time to gather your thoughts and get comfortable speaking up
  - avoid making generalizations or statements that are not based in facts—if you do not have facts, make your statement into a question and/or do your own research
- **Democracy:**
  - value diversity of thought & share power
  - encourage participation without forcing those who are not ready
  - embrace new ideas & honor dissent
  - remember that nobody has a monopoly on knowledge
  - it is okay to disagree with others; be sure to probe why you disagree without dismissing the other viewpoint  
- **Accountability:**
  - understand that your words can harm
  - address & educate when you witness bias
  - get comfortable addressing issues head on while not knowing all the answers—if you say the wrong thing, welcome the opportunity to learn
  - be aware of your own behavior and how it might affect others; be open to discussing how you have hurt others or been hurt yourself
- **What else?** This list is not comprehensive so please feel free to suggest items that you do not already see in your own classroom.

We take these principles seriously and hope that you will as well. Violation of these principles will not be tolerated—we will respond in appropriate ways that may include getting the institution involved, if necessary. If you feel these principles have been violated in your classroom and no one acknowledges it, please share information with your instructor or you can email lindycenter@drexel.edu.
